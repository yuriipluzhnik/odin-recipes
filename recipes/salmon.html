       <p><h3>The best grilled salmon recipe</h3></p>
       <p>This honey-glazed salmon is juicy, flaky, and so satisfying! Squeeze fresh lime juice over this honey glazed salmon and serve with steamy, fluffy white rice. Mmm… mouth. is. watering!!</p>
       <p>This idea for this salmon recipe was shared by one of my readers; IM. He wrote in with this honey soy salmon, saying, “honestly, best salmon I’ve ever had.” The list of ingredients is so short and simple. Between the easy prep and cooking, this is a 10-minute recipe with some seriously tasty results!</p>
       <p>I recommend boneless, skinless salmon. It can be done with skin-on if that is all you have and don’t want to take the time to remove it, but you lose some of the flavor when you remove the salmon skin later after sautéing it.</p>

       <ul>
        <li>4 (6 oz each, or about 24 oz total) Salmon Filets, boneless and skinless</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp light olive oil or any high-heat cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
       </ul>

       <ol>
          <li>To make the glaze: In a measuring cup, combine 1/4 cup honey and 2 Tbsp soy sauce. Stir until well combined and set aside.</li>
          <li>Season both sides of your boneless, skinless salmon filets with salt and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup flour into a shallow plate and dredge both sides of salmon in flour, shaking off excess flour.</li>
          <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add 2 Tbsp light olive oil. Note: Do not cook over high heat or you will burn the glaze.</li>
          <li>Brush the first side of salmon generously with half of the glaze and once oil is hot, add salmon to the pan (glaze-side-down). In the pan, brush the second side generously with remaining glaze. Saute salmon on the first side for 3 minutes, turn and sauté second side another 3 minutes. Glaze should be caramelized and salmon should be just cooked through and opaque inside when flaked.</li>
        </ol>
