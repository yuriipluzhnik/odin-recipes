        <p><h3>How to make a nyami lasagna</h3></p>
        <p>This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! There's something so amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna.  Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm, comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).</p>
        <p>This is a classic homemade lasagna recipe made with layers of gooey melted mozzarella cheese, a parmesan ricotta cheese, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is perfect for weeknight dinners, potlucks, or to take to friends who just had a baby.  This lasagna recipe can be frozen so it is perfect to made ahead of time. It also makes flavorful leftovers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 small Onion</li>
            <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. </li>
            <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer. </li>
        </ol>
